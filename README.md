# Perceptron
> _In progress if I'm not busy with other things_

A perceptron is just a recurrently-activated neural network that finds useful features or business intelligence in input data. Here's an insanely simple model:

You should ideally [santize](https://realpython.com/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/#tidying-up-fields-in-the-data) your data before using this API. You could use `pandas` or something similar to clean your data, not even breaking a sweat.

Ended up choosing to write the source code in Rust. [fast](https://kornel.ski/rust-c-speed) and [fun](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/). I'm pretty busy with school and other things right now so you're heavily encouraged to contribute.

Keep in mind that this is a binary classifier so craft each line in your `.csv` in the format of `<binary class [0 or 1]>, cartesian x, cartesian y`.

After you've done all that (and once this project is complete) it gets damn simple: `cargo run <path_to_.csv>`

If you're interested in seeing it work on a small dataset

```
cargo run < examples/small.csv
```

With the addition of a visualizer, the goal is to be able to see the perceptron updates in real-time.

### todo

1. Finish training

2. Create unit tests for the more nuanced datasets which may or may not be linearly separable.
